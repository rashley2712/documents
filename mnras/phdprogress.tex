%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Outline of the project}
Recent large scale synoptic surveys such as the Catalina Real-time Transit Survey (CRTS)  and the Pan-STARRS survey have yielded a large number of newly discovered transient objects. Many of these objects are compact binaries that exhibit transient phenomena due to the nature of the interaction of the components of the binary. This list includes cataclysmic variable stars that undergo outbursts, binaries that eclipse and pairs of stars that show modulation in their light-curves due to their orbit around each other. Understanding the evolution of these objects benefits from having a large population sample such that the broader statistics of the overall population can be modelled. This is used to place constraints on masses of the components, orbital mechanics and the relative time spent in each phase of the evolution of these systems. Objects detected in these large-scale surveys need to be studied in more detail through having their light-curves resolved with a higher time resolution and with more complete coverage than the surveys can provide. These photometric light-curves will reveal eclipses, phased modulations and timing variations and therefore allow the resolution of the orbital parameters of the systems. 

The University of Warwick has recently acquired a 1 metre telescope located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory. This telescope will be used to follow up new transient objects detected in current surveys such as, but not limited to, Pan-STARRS and CRTS. Since the telescope is not fully commissioned at the moment, a large portion of the PhD project will be the undertaking of the commissioning of the telescope including creation of the software required to operate the telescope remotely and robotically. 

\section{Literature review}

\subsection{Compact objects found in surveys}
\citet{Breedt2014} demonstrate the utility of large scale surveys in producing a list of transient objects worthy of follow up study. In this case the Catalina Real Time Survey (CRTS), \citep{Drake2009}. The original and primary purpose of CRTS is to detect near-Earth objects such as asteriods that are of interest to solar system astronomers and could be important for an early warning of any objects on a potential collision course with Earth. More generally, the survey has been used to identify many kinds of optical transients that vary on timescales from minutes to years. The most recent catalogue of identified transients can be found in \citet{CatalinaCatalog}. So far, CRTS has detected more than 9000 transient objects since its start of operations in 2007. The survey makes use of a network of  small telescope situation in yy locations around the world. The survey covers an area of the sky of $\sim 30,000\,deg^2$ between $-75^{o} < \delta < 65^o$ excluding an area of a few degrees near the galactic plan and revisits most locations many times per year with a typical cadence of around 2 weeks. The limiting magnitude of the survey is about $19-21$, depending on the telescope. Details of the telescopes and the observing program are described in \citet{Drake2009}. 

Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) is just one active area of research that can benefit from catalogues such as this one provided by CRTS. \citet{Breedt2014} use the catalogue to detect and investigate the population of CVs pulled from CRTS. Understanding a broader population of these objects enables the study of binary evolution of systems like this. CVs are compact binary objects that consist of a White Dwarf that is in close orbit with a main sequence companion and is accreting matter from that companion. During the lifetime of the CV the orbital period is expected to evolve. Since the orbital period is the most easily observable property of the system, it provides an important indicator to our understanding of the evolution of the system. We cannot usually observe the period changing on human timescales of tens of years so we need a larger population sample that can give us overview of the various stages of the evolution of the orbit. The orbits of CVs evolve from a long period (several hours) down to a period minimum of about 80 minutes. At this point the donor star will have lost enough mass such that it no longer contains enough to continue hydrogen burning at its core. The thermal timescale of the donor star, which describes how quickly its radius will contract in response to the mass loss, becomes longer than the mass loss itself and the star expands beyond the Roche lobe. Now the dynamics of the system force the separation of the two stars to increase and therefore period to increase. As the system approaches this period minimum, the accretion rate slows down, events take longer and therefore, in a large population sample, we would expect a build-up of systems with periods at around 80 minutes. This period spike has only recently been confirmed from analysis by \citet{Gaensicke2009} of the CVs found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
