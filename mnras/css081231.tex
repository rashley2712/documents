% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
CSS081231:071126+440405 is an eclipsing polar with a period of 117 minutes. Small and medium sized telescopes have photometry of the system dating back to late 2008. The ephemeris was computed shortly after discovery and then revised recently following five years of subsequent observations. Newer photometric observations have allowed us to place tighter contraints on the orbital parameters. We have obtained six optical spectra of the system covering phases 0.24 to 0.90 during outburst and sixteen optical spectra taken during quiescence. The spectra show clear cyclotron humps, revealing magnetic field strength of $B  \sim 34 MG$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.

CSS081231:071126+440405 is not a ROSAT source, but it appears in the Swift X-Ray Telescope Point Source Catalog \citep{2014ApJS..210....8E}. It was detected at $3.36 ^{+0.83} _{-0.72} cts/s$ in the full 0.3-10keV band, but the fluxes for the individual soft, medium and hard bands are also given. It is available from Vizier as catalogue IX/43.


\section{Observations}
Six nights of photometry were obtained using ULTRASPEC \citep{ULTRASPEC}, mounted on the 2.5m Thai National Telescope during 2014 and 2015. Exposure times varied from 1.6 to 3.6 seconds depending on the conditions of the night. For the first three observations the Sloane g filter was used and for the last three observations the KG5 filter was used. The KG5 filter has a broad optical passband stretching from $\sim3500 \AA~ \mbox{to} \sim7000 \AA$ and was chosen to allow the maximum light throughput without any potential contamination in the red from the M dwarf companion.  Data was reduced using the ULTRACAM pipeline (Marsh reference) with a comparison star located about xx arcminutes to XX from the target and located at RA, DEC. The details for these nights is shown in Table \ref{tab:photometry}. From this data we measure the eclipse ingress and egress times to a typical precision of 0.3 seconds. Light-curves of all of the eclipses are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:stacked-eclipses}. 

\begin{table}

The ephemeris given by \citet{Schwope2015} is 
\begin{equation}BJD(TDB) = 2454833.207868(14) + E\times0.0813768094(6)\end{equation}
but since our observations have been taken with instruments operating at a much higher time resolution than the sources used by Schwope, we have re-computed the ephemeris by combining our own eclipse times with those documented in the Schwope paper. Our recomputed ephemeris is 
\begin{equation}BJD(TDB) = 2454833.207854(12) + E\times0.0813768096(5)\end{equation}
a revised O-C plot is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ocdiagram} with the new eclipse times are indicated in green. The light curve for all of our high time resolution photometry is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lightcurves}.

\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.
