\section{The ULTRACAM instrument} 

The Ultracam high speed photometry camera (hereafter, ULTRACAM) had its `first-light' at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) on the 16 May 2002. Since then it has been used on many occasions at three telescopes, namely the William Herschel Telescope (WHT), La Palma, Islas Canarias, the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Cerro Paranal, Chile and New Technology Telescope (NTT), La Silla, Chile. The camera is designed to be portable and can travel between these telescopes. 

The camera has three CCD detectors enabling it to capture data in three colour bands simultaneously. Two dichroic beamsplitters divide the light from the collimator into three different beams, which shall hereafter be referred to as the `red', `green' and `blue' channels. The three CCD detectors are mounted at right angles to each other on the camera. Therefore, each detector is at the end of a slightly different optical path. While the exposure timing is synchronised across the detectors, it is, however, possible to have the detector in the blue channel remain exposed and not 'read-out' while the other two are going through multiple exposures and 'read-outs'. This is to allow for longer exposures where there might be less flux in blue. Reduced flux in blue is caused by several factors, including lower transmission of the optics and atmosphere to blue light, the reduced sensitivity of the CCD detector to blue light and the intrinsic flux of most astronomical objects are lower in this channel.

A key aspect of the design of the camera is its ability to perform at high cadence. It is possible to have the camera read-out at up to 500Hz (frames per channel per second) \cite{dhillon07}. This makes the camera useful for observations of rapid transient events with accurate timing. Although the camera is not often used in this very high speed mode, there are a few observing runs where the camera has been operating with exposure times of approximately 0.005 seconds. These runs are described in chapter~\ref{chap:results}.

The filters for each channel can be altered by the observer. In usual configurations the SDSS filter (u, g, r, i, z) set are used, but there are a selection of narrow-band filters that can be substituted. Depending on the science measurements that the observer is trying to perform, these filters will be changed.   

Each CCD has a total pixel area of 2057x1024 pixels. Half of these pixels are masked and never exposed to light. They are used as a temporary buffer for reading out the chip. CCD detectors are read out serially, but in order to decrease the time between exposures, the full image can be moved to the blanked out area of the chip and this can then be read out while the un-masked area of the chip is once again exposed to light.

\end{figure}

ULTRACAM gives the observer the option to reduce the area of the detector that is used for the exposure. This reduces the readout time of the chip and enables the high cadence. Reducing the number of pixels exposed also decreases the amount of data storage needed for the run. The observer can define pairs of \emph{windows} that are centered on their objects of interest. By making the windows suitably small, the observer can use the camera in extremely high cadence mode. 

The highest cadence mode is called \emph{Drift mode}. This mode uses the masked area of the CCD chip to store several exposures simultaneously. Only the portion of the CCD that is exposed is shifted into the masked area of the CCD meaning that the unmaksed area is ready to be re-exposed more quickly. This mode requires that only the lower portion of the detector, close to the boundary of the masked and un-masked areas, is exposed. Due to the geometry of this readout mode, it is necessary that the exposed area of the CCD is immediately adjacent to the boundary with the masked-off section of the chip. This means that the camera will have to be rotated so that the target object (and a suitable comparison star) are positioned correctly. The ULTRACAM is therefore designed to be rotated. For any particular run, it is possible that we can have \emph{any} orientation ($0-180^{\circ}$) of the camera relative to the sky coordinates. The ULTRACAM logs do not record this rotation angle. This is an important factor to remember when we try to find astrometric solutions for the runs.

\section{ULTRACAM data}

\subsection{Data capture}
Usually the camera remains installed on the telescope for a week or so and is used for observations on consecutive nights. Each separate recording of data is called a \emph{run}. On most nights, many \emph{runs} are recorded. A \emph{run} can be defined as a period when the camera is active and gathering data. Not all runs are used for gathering \emph{scientific} data. Some runs are used for target acquisition and camera calibration purposes. 

The types of runs are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Science run}: These are the runs that contain the valuable scientific data. They usually comprise the longest portions of the observations during the night, unless the camera is having difficulties or adverse conditions are preventing useful astronomical observations.
	\item \emph{Acquisition run}: These are runs, usually of short duration (ie a few minutes) during which the telescope is being moved in order to place the candidate object(s) in the field of view. The camera may also be rotated in order to align the CCD such that the targets avoid `bad' pixels or are near to the lower boundary of the detector (eg for high speed readout in Drift mode). 
	\item \emph{Flat field}: At the start and the end of the night (usually during twilight) the observer will take a few runs to create \emph{sky-flats} that will be used later for calibrating the variations in pixel sensitivity across each of the detectors.  Sky-flats are generated by exposing the camera to patches of sky during the twilight. 
	\item \emph{Bias}: A short run to build calibration readings for measuring the bias of the detector. This bias will be subtracted from the data during the reduction. 
	\item \emph{Timing calibration run}: One way to check the timing measurments of the camera is to take frames of a well-known rapidly oscillating source. For example, the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21). The timing of the pulses as measured by the camera can be compared to the expected times for the pulsar. This is used as a standard clock for timing calibration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The data archive}
At the time of writing, the ULTRACAM data archive comprises of about 10 terabytes of saved data. This can be broken down as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{390} nights on which ULTRACAM was operational at a telescope.
	\item \emph{12 256} runs, including science runs, acquisition runs, flat fields and biases. 
	\item \emph{119 817 742} frames in total. This total includes all the frames for each channel: red, green and blue.
	\item \emph{10 181 269 485 298} bytes of raw image data.
\end{itemize} 

The data set is relatively large and is housed on a network mounted storage device that is only available through the internal university computer network. This means that it is not possible to access this data from remote locations (for example, by research collaborators in different institutions). If a researcher needs to see some data, then they need to contact a member of department at Warwick or Sheffield and request a data reduction. There is no means to explore the ULTRACAM data set from a remote location. Providing a simple means of accessing the data from remote locations would benefit all of the research collaborators.
