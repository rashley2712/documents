Progress Report and Thesis Plan

A progress report of at least 3000 words is to be submitted after six months (usually Easter or equivalent date). By this time most of the experimental work / calculations should be complete. The report should clearly indicate the progress to date and may contain material that could be used in the introductory chapters of your MSc thesis. The report will:

\begin{itemize}
\item briefly review the chosen project field, putting the work in context
\item report on the research work completed
\item show what still needs to be done to complete the MSc research
\item contain a draft thesis plan, with detail of the contents down to sub-heading level, an indication of page numbers and the state of completedness of each section
\item include a detailed timetable for completion of the research and writing the thesis
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
