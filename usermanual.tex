\section{Running the pipeline}
The automated pipeline is run after the data has been obtained at the telescope. It operates on the raw ULTRACAM data, reducing it and preparing output files that are used for the Web browsing interface. The pipeline can be run anytime after the data has been recorded and is therefore useful for browsing and sharing ULTRACAM observations immediately after performing the observations, or much later, when wishing to check on a run that exist in the ULTRACAM archive.
