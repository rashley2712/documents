\section{Object identification}
For each night, an 'index page' is generated, which shows a list of all of the runs in the night along with thumbnail images of the field of view. This allows the user to quickly navigate to the runs that are 'of interest'. In other words, runs that contain science data, rather than acquisitions, biases, flat-fields. By clicking on the thumbnail of the run, they are taken to a 'run page'. This page shows the full image for each of the three channels. These images are created by stacking all of the individual frames in the run. The page also shows all of the objects that have been identified and have light-curves available. The user can view the light-curves by using the mouse to click on each object, or can scroll through all of the light-curves systematically, by using the left and right arrow keys. 

Scrolling through the light curves in a systematic fashion makes it easy for the user to quickly identify which objects are showing an obvious variability. All of the objects listed below were discovered in this way. 

The task is made relatively easy in the browser interface and it is possible to inspect the light curves at a rate of about 1-2 objects per second. In future, we plan to apply some statistical tests to the data to perform the light curve inspection as a stage of the automated pipeline. Algorithms to perform these sorts of tests are already known and becoming increasingly more widespread as more large scale sky surveys are being used throughout astronomy research. We plan to re-use work from one or more of these surveys. References to VVV, LSST, NGTS, Wasp, Astrokit software, etc.

\section{Discovered objects}

Below we list some of the variable objects that have discovered as a result of running the automated pipeline on a fraction of the ULTRACAM archive. The pipeline is usually invoked by running a single command on a night's worth of data. For example, to build the light-curves for the night of, say, \emph{2014-08-21}, then a single command, \emph{daybuilder.py 2014-08-21} is issued from the command line. The pipeline then runs through all of the data for that night and generates a set of web pages. Depending on the amount of data for that night, this can take 1 hour to 8 hours.

  The light curve of this object includes a primary eclipse of the object. Since the primary eclipse has a 'flat-bottom' we can conclude that this eclipse is total (ie that the primary is completely obscured by the secondary during the eclipse. This also means that the primary has a small diameter than the secondary. The primary eclipse duration is xxx minutes. The depth of the eclipse is about 0.7 magnitudes which corresponds to an actual drop in flux of 50\%. 

  It is notable that the ingress and the egress demonstrates broad 'wings' suggesting that the object being eclipsed (primary) is extended and the shape of the curve suggest distortion of the secondary.

  Although the object is in a Kepler field and is, in fact, close to KOI-1546, a search through the Kepler archive \footnote{\url{https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/data_search/search.php}} reveals that it is not listed. This is probably because the object is too faint.

  The light curve of this object displays a clear sinusoid which must be caused be the object's rotation. A periodogram of this data peaks at a frequency of $0.0108 minutes^{-1}$ (a spin period of $1.53$ hours) for the 'i' filter and $0.0098 minutes^{-1}$ (a spin period of $1.70$ hours) for the 'g' filter. We assume that this asteriod's spin is caused by the YORP effect \cite{yorpeffect}. 

  A look-up using the \emph{NEOChecker} tool on the website of the IAU's Minor Planet Center \footnote{http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/cgi-bin/checkneo.cgi} returns a result for this candidate as, most probably, asteroid \emph{1998 SU139}. The world coordinates reported by the tool differed from our own determination by about 6.5'. 

  There is a clear relationship between the size of the asteroid and the minimum spin period. Observationally, it can be shown that, for an asteroid with a diameter greater than 250 metres, the spin period cannot be less than 2.33 hours~\cite{Jacobson2014}. The theoretical reasoning for this 'spin cut-off'  is that, assuming these asteroids are 'rubble-piles' then the rotational forces will be stronger than the gravitational forces and the rubble pile will drift apart. It is even suggested that this scenario is the mechanism by which asteroid binary pairs are created. At the moment, only two asteroids have been found that are exceptions to this rule, \emph{2001 OE84} and \emph{2005 UW163} with periods of 0.486 and 1.290 hours respectively \cite{Chang2014}. 

  There are several more unconfirmed SFR asteroids reported by \cite{Masiero2009} and \cite{Dermawan2011}. Since these object have low birghtness and fast rotation, periods have not been accurately determined for them so far. Many of the light curves only have few tens of points. This project shows that ULTRACAM is a suitable instrument to use for follow up observations of these candidates.  

  The diameter of the asteroid can be estimated by using its absolute magnitude $H$ and an assumption for the albedo $p$ using the formula, adapted from Jewitt \cite{Jewitt2013}

  $D = \frac{1130}{\sqrt{p}}10^{-H/5} $

  We have taken $H = 15.2$ from the JPL Small-Body Database \footnote{http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi} and assumed an albedo of $ p = 0.297$ for a V-type asteroid. This gives a diameter, $D = 1.89 km$ for this asteroid. 

  If our period is correct, this could mean that we have discovered a new member of this rare, super-fast rotator (SFR) class of asteroid.If they are rubble-pile asteroids, then an additional mechanism is needed to explain how the object stays bound \cite{Holsapple2007}.

  Using the NEOChecker \footnote{http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/cgi-bin/checkneo.cgi} tool, the object detected in this run appears to be a well known asteroid, 9108 Toruyusa. The light curve, which lasts approximately 1 hour shows no significant variation and it has not been possible to determine a spin period for this asteroid.
