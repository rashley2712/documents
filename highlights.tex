\section{Discovered objects}

Below we list some of the variable objects that have discovered as a result of running the automated pipeline on a fraction of the ULTRACAM archive. All of the objects were noticed after browsing through the light-curves 'by eye'. That is, using a human to visually inspect each light curve one-by-one. This task is made relatively easy in the browser interface and it is possible to inspect at a rate of about 1-2 objects per second. In future, we plan to apply some statistical tests to the data to perform the light curve inspection as a stage of the automated pipeline. Algorithms to perform these sorts of tests are already known and becoming increasingly accurate as more large scale sky surveys launch. We plan to re-use work from one or more of these surveys.
